# metaphor_api
application for metaphor

A little bit about my files (more info on the notion document). Initially I wanted to take this challenge above and 
beyond and create a react app and use a published website for this challenge. I kept running into an error with openAI and NodeJS 
(which was frustrating because I've done it before), the code is all there and I should be able to get it working sooner or later
but simply ran out of time considering the 3 day turnaround. I also have the initial python file I created for my initial thinking that
is in the notion page. 

Thank you for your time and consideration!
